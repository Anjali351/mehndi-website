    <h2>ðŸŒ¿ Simple Home Remedies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Lemon & Sugar Mixture:</b> Dab gently with cotton once the mehndi starts drying.</li>
      <li><b>Clove Smoke:</b> Warm your hands above clove steam to lock in the color.</li>
      <li><b>Apply Balm:</b> After scraping mehndi off, rub Vicks or mustard oil for deeper stains.</li>
      <li><b>No Water:</b> Avoid washing hands with water for at least 10â€“12 hours.</li>
